# Contributing

Sometimes, a repository will have a "contributing file" like this one. You'll usually see this if

- The repository has a LOT of code
- A LOT of people want to contribute to the repository
- The repository is accepting contributions from other people

Some small examples include:

- [dotfiles.github.com](https://github.com/dotfiles/dotfiles.github.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [awesome-bash's contributing.md](https://github.com/awesome-lists/awesome-bash/blob/master/contributing.md)
- [tj/git-extras's CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tj/git-extras/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [schemastore's CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you are interested in contributing to other (open source) projects, [this article on opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute) is a very useful thorough guide/walkthrough/explainer.
